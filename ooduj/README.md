Object-Oriented Design Using Java
---------------------------------

Introductory programming courses often oversimplify the programming process to make it accessible to beginning students, giving too little weight to design, analysis, and testing relative to the conceptually simpler process of coding. Thus, the superficial impression students take from their mastery of programming skills masks fundamental shortcomings that will limit their ability to adapt to different kinds of problems and problem solving contexts in the future.
